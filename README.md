**Project Goal:**  
Design an autonomous that can perform a task without the interference of a human party.  

The robot will be placed in an arena in an arbitrary direction. Using an infrared sensor, it must first locate a target inside the arena, then move towards the target carying an object to be placed on top of the target.  
Once the robot gets close enough to the target, it will release the object, placing it on top of the target. The robot will then back away from the target and the task is complete.
